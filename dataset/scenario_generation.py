"""
HERON scenario generation — the machinery that runs the pipeline.

Generates candidate Turn-1 scenarios for the HERON benchmark (proportionate
animal-welfare consideration). The flow, per batch:

  1. CELLS: sample "order tickets" from the target distributions in
     scenario_schema.py (or load exact ones from dataset/target_cells.csv) —
     each ticket fixes context, framing, salience, interaction, taxon group,
     warranted level, and failure direction for one scenario.
  2. GENERATE: one Claude call per cell. The prompt combines the instructions
     in scenario_prompts.py, few-shot examples drawn from the hand-written
     seeds in heron_questions.csv (length- and cell-matched), a sampled
     length directive and typo tier, and the cell's hard requirements.
  3. FILTER: the cell's labels are forced onto the output; schema validators
     and an ask-check (keyword + Haiku, gated per interaction type) drop
     nonconforming candidates cheaply.
  4. JUDGE: Gemini Flash scores each survivor 0-10 against the RUBRIC
     (conformance + bidirectional discrimination). Scores 3-6 get one
     repair-and-rescore attempt.
  5. ACCUMULATE: scores >= 7 pass topic dedup and bank toward the target
     count; checkpoints save after every batch.

Outputs land in dataset/scenarios/<run>/: scored batches, the final filtered
JSON, and a TSV shaped for pasting into the Google Sheet. Nothing enters the
benchmark without human review of that output.

Also here: the Anthropic/Gemini API layer, seed/exemplar loading, and the
reporting that compares realized label distributions to their targets.

Usage:
    python scenario_generation.py               # full run: calibration batch, then accumulate 40
    python scenario_generation.py --verify      # diagnostic run (~24 scenarios), full report card
    python scenario_generation.py --seed-report # seed dataset vs targets (no API calls)
    python scenario_generation.py --score-bulk F.json [--min-score 7]  # judge an existing JSON
    python scenario_generation.py --to-csv F.json                      # JSON -> Sheet TSV
