"""
HERON scenario schema — the vocabulary layer of the generation pipeline.

Defines what a scenario IS, with no runtime logic:
  - TAXON_GROUPS: the 10 animal groups, their member animals, and the
    animal-name text scan that powers the animal_absent salience check
  - The Pydantic models: Scenario (a question plus all its labels) with its
    validators, and the structured-output wrappers the LLM calls return
    (ScenarioGeneration, QCResponse, QCScenario)
  - The target distributions: what fraction of generated scenarios should
    have each context, framing, salience, interaction, warranted level, and
    failure direction — plus the pairing/compatibility tables between them
  - Cell: one "order ticket" (a full combination of the above) that a single
    generation call is asked to satisfy

Pipeline layering (dependencies flow one way):
  scenario_schema.py  <-  scenario_prompts.py  <-  scenario_generation.py
This file imports nothing local. Change it when adding/renaming categories
or adjusting the dataset's target mix.
